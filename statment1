Hello, my name is Nichakan Phatikasemsan Nickname is Mimie. 
Now I dropped out of formal education. Became self-study in a Non-formal education (กศน.) and GED and the same time. 
After graduating with GED, I started to see more of my potential than before.
From the person who thinks studying is hard, regularly fail to concentrate on my studies, and always need to be pushed.
I turn myself around since I committed to passing GED, then almost everything I go through it by myself.
So now I am a new person who is eager to seek more knowledge and have commitment.

I want to study Data engineer because today data is around us. even someone said "This is the era of data"
so I think Data engineer will be one part that helps make something better.
Also, this field is evolving at a fast speed so I think it is a good decision
to jump in right now to be part of something new
to study and develop something new for making something better.
I believe that I have enough potential to study in this field
because this field would require enthusiastic learners and keep learning 
which is something that I am good at.

Due to the situation of covid 19, Most of the activities that I have taken were online self-study.
I studied Python3 course on Codecademy, 12 Data Engineer Fundamentals courses on LinkedIn,
and 1 course on Thai MOOC. and volunteer in activities of non-Formal education.

For my future goals, there are: 
1. Personal goals are self-improvement in order to keep up with new technology and take my knowledge for a living.
2. Public goals, I want to be a small part that helps develop a data engineer career in Thailand
and use my applied data engineer knowledge
for the public and want to share this knowledge for next-generation or someone who is interested in.
